# 💖 Valentine Proposal – 3D Particle Heart

An interactive Valentine’s Day experience created through the **power of modern creative tools, well-crafted prompts, and careful manual refinement**.

This project is not about writing every line of code by hand —  
it’s about **guiding the magic**, shaping it, and polishing it into something meaningful.

## ✨ What This Is

A cinematic, interactive Valentine proposal where:

- A glowing **3D particle heart** reacts to user interaction
- Zooming inward reveals heartfelt messages
- Touch, gestures, and motion control the experience
- Fireworks celebrate the moment

It’s a blend of **emotion, motion, and interactivity**.

## 🪄 How It Was Made (The Honest Truth)

This project was created using:

- ✨ **The power of AI-generated code**
- ✍️ **Carefully written prompts**
- 🛠️ **Manual tuning, debugging, and visual refinement**

The real work wasn’t “generate and done”.

It involved:
- Iterating prompts until the geometry and motion felt right
- Understanding why something looked wrong
- Manually fixing rotation, alignment, zoom limits, and responsiveness
- Adjusting layouts for mobile vs desktop
- Refining interactions so they feel smooth and intentional

**Magic works best when you know how to guide it.**

## 🛠️ Tech Used (Behind the Magic)

- **Three.js** — real-time 3D rendering
- **HTML5 Canvas** — rendering surface
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** — animation & interaction logic
- **CSS3** — UI overlays & responsive layout
- **MediaPipe Hands** — gesture-based interaction
- **GitHub Pages** — hosting

## 💡 Why This Project Exists

This project explores a simple idea:

> Creativity today isn’t just about writing code —  
> it’s about asking the right questions, refining the output,  
> and knowing when to step in manually.

A Valentine proposal felt like the perfect canvas for that.
